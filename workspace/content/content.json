However, if the above is not working and you have challenged your client (with permission), it may be an indicator to move into the middle level, to work with some of the RTC\u00ae Tools. The client may want to do this anyway as part of working with you as an RTC\u00ae Coach.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bear in mind, it may take more than 1 session using the coaching tools to identify whether you need to move your client to the RTC\u00ae level. Once these goals have been achieved, you could ask a set of closed questions or \u2018push\u2019 questions based on what you worked on with the RTC\u00ae Tools.
